Strapi -> headless CMS built with Node.js -> backend API
Stripe -> payments
Svelte -> routing, stores
Cloudinary -> Manage, optimize, and deliver images and videos at scale
Netlify -> host & deploy our Svelte Frontend App
Heroku -> host & deploy Backend API Strapi App

1.Routing

 -> no built-in routing for Svelte
 -> https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing
 -> npm install npm install --save svelte-routing   -> very similar with react-router-dom
 -> { Router, Route, Link }
 -> Can't use class on <Link>. Use getProps() for style. Better solution is to use {link}  -> use: link
  !!!! for button links the best solution is to use <a href="/" use:link>  !!!!!!!!

2. Store

- single source of truth - store
- generally we set multiple stores: products store, cart store, global store etc.
- subscribe to the store
- store object offers us methods: subscribe(), set(), update() -> see with console.log(store)
- store unsubscribe() -> clean the subscription after unmounting the component
                      -> unsubscribe() the store when the component unmounts
                      -> avoid memory leaks
- store unsubscribe() shorthand: $productsStore -> unsubscribe() automatically when unmount


import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

filter()
Derived store -> if you are using the same functionality multiple places it does make sense to use derived store

let screenWidth;
<svelte:window bind:innerWidth={screenWidth}>


3. Strapi

- STRAPI -> most popular free headless CMS
- STRIPE-> payment processor vs Paypal
- CLAUDINARY.io-> host our images
- HEROKU -> deploy & host our strapi app
- NETLIFY -> deploy & host our frontend Svelte

New Strapi app
->   npx create-strapi-app my-project --quickstart
-> --quickstart mean that you get a default DB -> sqlLite
->   npm run develop
Strapi is a Node.js app
-> localhost:1337/admin

-> In production you will have to add your data one more time to Strapi Admin Dashboard
-> By default access to our API is restricted localhost:1337/products -> Rules & permissions

Users is created by deafult in Strapi.
When we login we get a token.
